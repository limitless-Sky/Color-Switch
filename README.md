JavaFX application for the game - Color Switch. The objective of the game is to collect
as many stars as possible by manoeuvring the obstacles. If you hit any obstacle, you can continue
with your earned stars or the game ends and you have to start from the beginning. This is a high
score game. We will be developing only the endless (infinity) game mode of the classic
gameplay.
